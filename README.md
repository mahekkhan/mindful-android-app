## Android app: “Mindful”
*February - April 2020*
- Collaborated with a team of four people to make an android application that show inspection reports of restaurants in Surrey, BC.
- Designed a data model that can efficiently be mapped with front end parts.
- Led a group of four team members for the final iteration to test and finalize a usable version of the application.
- Tested the application in every iteration to make sure every component in it works perfectly.
